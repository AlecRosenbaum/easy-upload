## What is This

This is really simple, not really secure way of transferring files/pictures/whatever over a local network.

This is basically just a go version of (this small php project)[https://github.com/josephernest/Yopp]

This mainly an exercise in writing my first go program, then connecting it to travis-ci and github pages. You know, for fun.

## How to Use

* Download + run binary (see releases)
* A browser window will open up with the link and an upload button
* visit that link on any device connected to local wifi and upload files
* uploaded files will be placed in the directory the binary is running in
