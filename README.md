## What is This

This is really simple, not really secure way of transferring files/pictures/whatever over a local network.

Inspired by [this php script](https://github.com/josephernest/Yopp)

## How to Use

* `go get https://github.com/AlecRosenbaum/easy-upload`
* A browser window will open up with the link and an upload button
* visit that link on any device connected to local wifi and upload files
* uploaded files will be placed in the directory the binary is running in
